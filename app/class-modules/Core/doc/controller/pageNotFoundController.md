PageNotFoundController
============
2017-04-28




This controller displays a "page not found" page, using a [laws](https://github.com/lingtalfi/laws) view.
The laws view uses the [HttpError widget](https://github.com/KamilleWidgets/HttpError).

It's there for you to use if you want, but there is no route for it, you need to create a route yourself if you want
to use it.
