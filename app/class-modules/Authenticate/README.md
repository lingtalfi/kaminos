Authenticate
================
2017-04-10




This module brings the [authenticate system](https://github.com/lingtalfi/Authenticate) to your kamille application.




It basically provides hooks for other modules to tap into the authenticate system (bring their own profile and badges,
or even users).

But the main feature it brings is accessible via the "has" method of the A class, at the application level,
which basically is a wrapper for the Grantor has method (from the authenticate planet).
