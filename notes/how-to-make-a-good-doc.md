How to make a good doc?
===========================
2017-05-10


I believe a good doc should be split in three parallel branches, describing the same things,
but with different approaches:



- pragmatical: a tutorial, few or no theoretical explanations:
                    do this, then do that style
- hacker: linear explanations of how things are.
                        What the important steps of the thing described are, with precise details: which method,
                        which file, which argument (pertaining to the discussion) does what.
                        So that the hacker user can retrace the process and use the doc as an assistant guide.
- philosophical: why did those decisions made, describe things at the abstract level.
