A system to give user permissions.



This is part of the [universe framework](https://github.com/karayabin/universe-snapshot).


Install
==========
Using the [uni](https://github.com/lingtalfi/universe-naive-importer) command.
```bash
uni import AuthenticatedUser
```

Or just download it and place it where you want otherwise.

Having the permission to do something is equivalent to ask the question: do you have that badge?
